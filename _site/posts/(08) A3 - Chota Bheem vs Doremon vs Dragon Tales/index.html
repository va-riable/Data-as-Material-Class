<li><p>The <code>histogram</code> shows significant overlap across all three cartoons in terms of rating. This implies that the shows and ratings do not have much relation or dependancy in this sample.</p></li>
<li><p>The overall mean lies somewhere around 7, with Doraemon having a mode at the highest values, 8 and 10. There seems to be no ratings at 9.

<p>Why perform ANOVA before checking for its assumptions?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Because, it is an <strong>exploratory</strong> data analysis!!</p>
<p>Also, ANOVA is relatively robust to minor violations of assumptions, especially with large, balanced sample sizes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normality: With large samples (often n &gt; 30 per group), the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the mean distribution becomes approximately normal, making ANOVA results reasonably accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>Homogeneity of variance: If group sizes are equal or nearly equal, ANOVA can tolerate some differences in variance across groups without severely affecting results.</p></li>

<li><p>the <code>mean difference</code> of Dragon Tales v/s Chhota Bheem is <code>0.597.</code> Once again, the confidence interval includes 0, and the <code>p-value</code> of <code>0.2877</code> exceeds 0.05, indicating that any difference in means is a chance encounter.</p></li>
<li><p>the <code>mean difference</code> of Dragon Tales v/s Doraemon is <code>0.017.</code> This time too, the confidence interval includes 0, and the <code>p-value</code> of <code>1.000</code> exceeds 0.05, again, indicating that any difference is likely due to chance.</p></li>
<li><p>To conclude, at the 95% confidence level with Boneferroni correction, the mean ratings of all three cartoons do not significantly differ from one another. The observed mean differences that do exist are not statistically meaningful, suggesting that the groups are likely similar in their average ratings. That is, there viewers do not strongly favor any show over another. <strong>According to this test, Case 0, the Null Hypothesis, is true.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly,</p>
<ul>
<li>Chhota Bheem has very similar difference in mean with the other two shows. What could this mean? Perhaps simply that the underlying distributions are similar (as they can potentially have data points clustering around similar values), which means that both cartoons cater to a similar demographic (Nostalgic Adults and Children!!!) But again, the test indicates that these differences in means are anyway likely due to chance - and hence not statistically significant.</li>

<p>How can this be, when the ANOVA results suggested that 0 was included in the 95% confidence intervals of the mean differences in each pair of groups? Which test do we take as true? Should we use a non-parametric tests that do not assume normality? If these non-parametric tests exist, why even check for normality in the first place? Does a normal distribution tell us other things? What is the significance of a normal distribution? (I must visit my stats basics it seems)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On prompting ChatGPT and Google:</p>
<p>While non-parametric tests are valuable tools for analyzing data that do not meet the assumptions of normality, checking for normality remains an essential part of the data analysis process. It informs the choice of statistical tests, enhances the understanding of data characteristics, and can lead to more effective and powerful analyses when parametric tests are appropriate. Ultimately, a comprehensive approach that considers both parametric and non-parametric options based on the data’s distribution can yield the most meaningful insights.</p>

<li>Though the maginitude of the variances as computed in the table seem to indicate that there is significant difference in the variance, The Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances here, with a p-value of 0.4038 shows that those values are not statistically significant. Hence, the test implies that the <strong>variances are homogeneous</strong>, supporting the second assumption/condition for conducting ANOVA</li>

<p>The way in which the data was gathered ensured that each observation is Independent.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hence, two out of three ANOVA assumptions have been confirmed. It still makes sense to perform ANOVA, as it is typically robust against violations of normality, especially with balanced groups and sample sizes &gt;=30 (which this sample fulfills.</p>

<li>The infer based permutation test shows that the observed F-statistic falls well within the permutationally generated F-statistics, and the large red region indicates that the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed statistic under the null hypothesis is quite high.</li>

<p>The null hypothesis cannot be rejected, that is, there is no statistically significant difference in the means of the ratings of the three cartoons.</p>

<p>Overall, ANOVA can be carried out using the standard formula&nbsp;<code>aov</code>&nbsp;when assumptions on distributions, variances, and independence are met. Since these tests test for different aspects of the data sample under the null hypothesis, their reuslts may vary from eachother. Permutation ANOVA tests can be carried out when these assumptions do not quite hold.</p>
