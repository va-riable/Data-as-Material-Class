What better way to finally reflect, if not with graphs?\n\n.\n\nFirst I ranked each day of the course out of 10 on my `understanding` of the course material, my `learnings` and my `joy` levels. The following is a rundown of my code process to get to the graphs from this data, and then finally, my final final reflection :)\n\n.\n\nDISCLAIMER! - all inferences and data uncovered on this page must be taken with a mighty grain of salt. I've defined the rankings, and if anything, im a bit of a `va-riable` myself.\n\n### Setup Chunk:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'kableExtra'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    group_rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mosaic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

Somehow, there is still so much more in the realm of R to be explored – I’m only just realizing that 12 days is barely anything in terms of the learning curve. Apart from R and RStudio, this class has taught me various things.\n\n.\n\n-   A blog for the web need not have to be some tediously hand-coded HTML document – the versatility of quarto takes care of all that.\n\n    .\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-    I think I will also forever look at excel sheets differently; the potential in all those columns and rows for some seriously good art!\n\n    .\n\n-   Providing incentive goes a long way, acting as a catalyst for efficiency in data collection. Even better when the costs are shared, it’s definitely a good investment.\n\n    .\n\n-   Good design is informed by solid data. Hypothesis developed from the very same data is often built on pretences. That does not mean the conclusion isn’t credible: oftentimes, hypotheses are made up to be disproved, since doing the opposite isn’t feasible.\n\n    .\n\nSafe to say, this class has also left me with some questions:\n\n.\n\n-   Eliminating bias in terms of who the data is coming from is done with a coin toss. What about the data itself? How can a researcher account for false statements or partial truths?\n\n    .\n\n-   Trust – in both data and research process begs the question of ethics. Collaborative environments are inevitable, and navigating through them is sometimes more complicated than figuring out R. I can account for myself, but what about situations where I make up one of many parts? My group, my class, my institution?\n\n    .\n\nCollecting data ourselves was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Generally, the thought of approaching random people acts as repellent enough from the task assigned, but just a few interviews in, the chocolates seemed to be performing their magic. It was also comforting to know that it did not matter who I approached – all was decided by the flip of a coin. The coin toss also became this sort of identifier: many guessed with an “Oh, are you in Arvind’s class?” before the question was even asked.\n\n.\n\nThis won’t be goodbye, as there’s the whole of A3 to power through and hopefully some online classes as well. Super excited about all the resources I now have, especially those to pore over maps!!\n",
