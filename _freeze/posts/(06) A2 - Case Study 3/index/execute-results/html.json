2.3 Observations\n\n-   This data set consists of only those who work in the health sector, in 2016.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Only one occupation has no males and 100% females that make up its workforce: Nurse midwives.\n\n-   Two occupations, Dietitians and Nutritionists, as well as Medical Records and Health Information Technicians both have a `wage_percent_of_male` as more than 100%. How is that possible?\n\n-   The `total_earnings` coloumn is most of the times, of not less than `total_earnings_female` and `total_earnings_male` coloumns, How is that possible? Have I misunderstood the data?\n\n    In fact, upon closer inspection, it seems to lie in the middle of `total_earnings_female` and `total_earnings_male`. Interesting. Perhaps the data has been modified, but labelled incorrectly? A case of `total_earnings = median(total_earnings)` ??\n\n.\n\n.\n\n## 3.

Task and Discussion\n\n.\n\n### From the Course Website\n\n.\n\n-   ***What kind of chart is used in the figure?***\n\n    A Scatter Plot!\n\n    .\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   ***What geometries have been used and to which variables have these geometries been mapped?***\n\n    The circles represent clusters of workers by occupation, and their sizes represent the total number of workers within that occupation. The placement of the circle with regards to the x-axis defines the percentage of female workers within that cluster, and the placement of the circle with regards to the y-axis defines the median salary in that occupation.\n\n    .\n\n-   ***Based on this graph, do you think gender plays a role in salaries? What is the trend you see?***\n\n    Based on this graph, its quite evident that gender plays a role in salaries. As the graph moves towards majority of the workforce as women, the dots cluster at the vottom rungs of the y-axis, indicating lower median incomes.\n\n    .\n\n-   ***If SALARY, NO_OF_WORKERS, GENDER, OCCUPATION were available in the original dataset, what pre-processing would have been necessary to obtain this plot?***\n\n    Steps for pre-processing in that case:\n\n    `df %>%`\n\n    `group_by(occupation) %>%`\n\n    `summarize(workers_female = count(gender == \"female\"),`\n\n    `percent_female = (workers_female/no_of_workers)*100,`\n\n    `meadian_salary = median(salary)) %>% ggplot(...)... and so on.`\n\n.\n\n.\n\n### My Journey with this Case Study\n\nTBF\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-   I prompted ChatGPT with \"scatter plot with different sized dots in r, using tidyverse , ggformula, mosaic, skimr\" and it came up with a sample data set and code chunk. After running the code and playing around with factors such as `scale_size(range =c())`, `geom_point(alpha =)`, label inputs, as well as messing around with I had a pretty good idea of how things worked.\n\n    .\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## ChatGPT:  Sample dataset\nset.seed(42)  # For reproducibility\ndata <- tibble(\n  x = rnorm(100),                  # Random normal values for x-axis\n  y = rnorm(100),                  # Random normal values for y-axis\n  size = runif(100, 1, 10),        # Random sizes for the dots\n  category = sample(letters[1:3], 100, replace = TRUE)  # Random categories\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Chat GPT: Create scatter plot with varying dot sizes\nggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y, size = size, color = category)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +  # Adjust alpha for transparency\n  scale_size(range = c(1, 10)) +  # Control the size range\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot with Varying Dot Sizes\",\n       x = \"X-axis Label\",\n       y = \"Y-axis Label\",\n       size = \"Size Legend\",\n       color = \"Category\") +\n  theme_minimal()  # Use a minimal theme\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
